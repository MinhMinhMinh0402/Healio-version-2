Notifications: Need to have a mechanism to send automatic notifications.
4. Backend Completion
API Connection: Ensure data from AI, appointments, and health records are synchronized.
Data Security: Since this is a health platform, data encryption and two-factor authentication need to be applied.
1. Finalize the user interface (UI/UX)
Review the existing web interface design, ensure consistency and user-friendliness.
Develop a mobile interface if not yet available.
Optimize the user experience by testing with a small group.

notifications (notifications).
ai_diagnosis (AI diagnosis data).
III. FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT
Project setup:
Use React Native or Flutter to create project.
Configuration of UI libraries such as React Navigation, TailwindCSS, Redux (state management).
Build main interface screen:
HomeScreen.js: Display health notifications.
DiagnosisScreen.js: Form to enter symptoms, call AI API.
DoctorConnectScreen.js: Find & book an appointment with a doctor.
ProfileScreen.js: Personal information, medical history.
LoginScreen.js: Authenticate users.
Backend API Integration:
Use Axios or Fetch API to connect to the backend.
Example: Call the API to get diagnosis results:
javascript
Copy
Edit
axios.get("https://api.healio.com/diagnosis", {
params: { userId: 123 }
}).then(response => {
setDiagnosis(response.data);
});
Security handling:
Authenticate users with JWT or OAuth.
Encrypt medical data when transmitting.
IV. BACKEND DEVELOPMENT & AI INTEGRATION
Set up backend with Node.js & Express:
Create backend project with express-generator.
Configure CORS, authentication middleware.
Build API:
POST /auth/register: Register an account.
POST /auth/login: Login & create token.
POST /diagnosis: Get symptoms from user, send to AI.
GET /appointments: Get appointment list.

Simple AI code example:
python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv("medical_data.csv")
X = data.drop("diagnosis", axis=1)
y = data["diagnosis"]

model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X, y)

def predict(symptoms):
return model.predict([symptoms])
Implement AI with FastAPI or Flask and connect to Node.js backend.
V. INTEGRATING BLOCKCHAIN (SAFE MEDICAL ARCHIVES)

Write a contract to store medical records on the blockchain.
Simple contract example:
solidity
Copy
Edit
contract MedicalRecord {
struct Record {
string diagnosis;
uint256 date;
}
mapping(address => Record[]) public records;

function addRecord(string memory _diagnosis) public {
records[msg.sender].push(Record(_diagnosis, block.timestamp));
}
}
Deploy to Ethereum or Hyperledger:
Use Truffle or Hardhat to deploy smart contract.
Connect to frontend via Web3.js or Ethers.js.

I want you to adjust the **Healio** web interface to **automatically adapt** to devices with different screen sizes, especially **mobile phones**. Make sure the interface:

1. **Responsive Design**
- Use **CSS Flexbox or Grid** to make elements stretch flexibly.

- Make sure the content does not overflow when viewed on small screens.

- Apply **media queries** to adjust font size, padding, margin to suit each type of screen.

2. **Optimized layout on mobile**
- Convert **columns to vertical rows** if necessary, to avoid confusing users.

- **Buttons, input forms, checkboxes** must be of appropriate size for easy operation on touch.

- Menu or navigation bars **should be converted to hamburger menu** to save space.

4. **Optimize the input experience**
- If there is a login or data entry form, make sure:
- Use the appropriate keyboard (email, phone number, password).
- Auto-focus and auto-complete when necessary.

Make sure all changes make the **Healio** experience on the phone **smooth, easy to use and professional**.
